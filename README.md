## About The Project

The purpose of this project is to build an end-to-end, data-driven fantasy basketball assistant that automates daily decisions involving lineup selection, waiver wire pickups, and trade targets.

## Usage

- ```execute_cleaners.py```: Executes a series of data engineering steps by calling upon helper modules. 
    - Raw data files are located within `data/raw`. Processed files are saved to `data/processed`. Helper cleaner modules are in the `cleaners` directory.
- ```hot_streak_finder.py```: Implements a divide-and-conquer algorithm to discover seasonal patterns in player performance, in order to aid fantasy users in waiver-wire decisions.
  - Calls upon helper modules in `utils`.
- ```fantasy_trades_cluster_analysis.py```: Explores the applicability & potency of unsupervised algorithms in building a strategic fantasy draft tool.
- ```tests```: Contains the unit-tests for all the scripts.
