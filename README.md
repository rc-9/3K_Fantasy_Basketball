## About The Project

The project was pursued to explore new tools and sharpen programming skills, with the eventual goal of building a data-driven fantasy basketball assistant. 

## Usage

- ```execute_cleaners.py```: Executes a series of data engineering steps by calling upon helper modules. 
    - Raw data files are located within `data/raw`. Processed files are saved to `data/processed`. Helper cleaner modules are in the `cleaners` directory.
- ```hot_streak_finder.py```: This tool implements a divide-and-conquer algorithm to discover seasonal patterns in player performance, in order to aid fantasy users in waiver-wire decisions.
  - Calls upon helper modules in `utils`.
- ```fantasy_trades_cluster_analysis.py```: Explores the applicability & potency of unsupervised algorithms in building a strategic fantasy draft tool.
- ```tests``` directory contains the unit-tests for all the scripts.
